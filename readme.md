Here's a cleaner, more professional version of your README file for your Express REST API app:

---

# 🚀 Express REST API – User Management

A simple yet production-ready Express.js REST API that performs CRUD operations on user data stored in a JSON file.

---

## 📚 Features

* ✅ Full CRUD operations on users
* ✅ Modular folder structure (MVC pattern)
* ✅ Express Router for routing
* ✅ Centralized error handling middleware
* ✅ JSON file used as a mock database
* ✅ Input validation using `express-validator` (optional if you’ve added this)

## 📌 API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/users`
